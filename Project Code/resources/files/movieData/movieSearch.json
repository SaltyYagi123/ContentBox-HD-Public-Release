But it's more than just a clever nod in the direction of contemporary film noir, just as it's more than an incestuous joke at the expense of the London based media world: it's a telling comment on the contemporary media culture of postmodernism.","original_language":"en","original_title":"Taxi Driver Two","video":false,"title":"Taxi Driver Two","genre_ids":[],"poster_path":null,"backdrop_path":null,"release_date":"1987-01-01","popularity":0.6,"vote_average":0,"id":300120,"adult":false,"vote_count":0},{"overview":"Walt Disney's re-imagineering of Martin Scorsese's classic film Taxi Driver follows Mickey Mouse-obsessed Travis Bickle as he looks for love in a rapidly transforming New York City.
